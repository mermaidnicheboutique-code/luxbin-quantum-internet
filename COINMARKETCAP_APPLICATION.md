**9. Project Description:**
```
LUXBIN (LUX) is the world's first cryptocurrency backed by real quantum computing infrastructure. Using 445 qubits across 3 IBM quantum computers (ibm_fez, ibm_torino, ibm_marrakesh), LUXBIN generates true quantum randomness for tokenomics mechanisms including deflationary burns (3%), automatic holder rewards (2%), treasury buybacks (2%), and a quantum lottery (1%).

Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that use pseudo-random algorithms, LUXBIN's quantum entropy is physically impossible to predict or manipulate, providing provably fair distributions and creating unique value through quantum-secured scarcity. Deployed on Base (Coinbase Layer 2) with ERC-20 standard.

Key Features:
- 445 qubits of real quantum computing power
- Deflationary tokenomics with quantum burns
- Passive income through quantum reflections
- Unpredictable treasury buybacks
- Quantum lottery with provably fair randomness
- 99% more energy efficient than Bitcoin
- Secured by laws of quantum physics

### Token Metrics

**31. Total Supply:**
```
1000000000
(1 billion LUX)
```

**32. Circulating Supply:**
```
[Current supply minus burned tokens]
Example: 950000000 (if 50M burned)

Update formula: Total Supply - Burned Tokens
```

**33. How to calculate circulating supply?**
```
Query contract for total supply and subtract burned tokens:
- View burned tokens at: [Burn address holdings]
- Subtract locked liquidity
- Subtract team/treasury vested tokens

OR provide API endpoint:
https://api.luxbin.io/circulating-supply
```

**34. CMC Methodology Compliance:**
```
☑ I confirm circulating supply follows CMC methodology
(Excludes: burned tokens, locked liquidity, unvested team tokens)
```

---

### Supply Distribution

**35. Token Distribution Breakdown:**
```
- 30% Public Sale/Liquidity (300M LUX)
- 25% Ecosystem Rewards (250M LUX)
- 20% Team/Advisors (200M LUX - 4 year vest, 1 year cliff)
- 15% Strategic Partnerships (150M LUX)
- 10% Community/Airdrops (100M LUX)

Note: Burned tokens are permanently removed from supply.
```

**36. Lockup Details:**
```
- Initial Liquidity: Locked 12 months via [Unicrypt/Team.Finance]
- Team Tokens: 4-year linear vesting, 1-year cliff
- Strategic Allocation: Released based on milestone achievement
```

### Proof of Reserves (Optional but Recommended)

```
Sign a message from your treasury/team wallet to prove ownership:

Message: "CoinMarketCap listing for LUXBIN (LUX) - [Today's Date]"
Signature: [Generated signature]
Wallet: 0x[your-wallet-address]
```
